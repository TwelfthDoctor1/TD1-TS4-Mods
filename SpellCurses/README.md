# [RoM] SpellCurses Mod

As Sage of Untamed Magic, I introduce to you my Spell-Curses mod. 

This mod adds in 9 Spell-curses into the game. All curses are from RoM.

IMPORTANT: Spellcasters with Hexproof Perk WILL be able to get cursed from the spells. You’ve been warned.
Hexproof is a perk, not a trait or a buff. The tunings in the package do not have any reference to perks, therefore I cannot blacklist the perk. 

How To Learn The Spells:
Your sim needs to Rank Virtuoso (Rank 5) to learn the spells from the Sage of Untamed Magic. There are no tomes for the spells.

The spells are based of a Rank 5 spell (in this case, Duplicato), Rank 5 spells can only be taught by a Sage.

[hings that I must say now:
The spell-curses can not only be cast on a target sim, it can also be cost on the sim who cast it.

[Modifying]:
You can modify the tunings to fit your needs.

Versions:
Main Version - All sims can get the effects of the spell.

SageProof Version - Sages are Hexproof to the spell. Perfect for people who has sages in their households or wants sages to be immune to them.

Requirements:
