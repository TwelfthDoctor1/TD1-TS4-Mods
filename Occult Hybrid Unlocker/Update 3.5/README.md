# Update Log

UPDATE 3.5: Accidentally broke the Rite of Ascension to work with Hybrids. Fixed. Thanks Malcolm Landgrabb for rooting to the issue.

UPDATE 3: Finally figured out the issue regarding why Vampires can't turn other occult sims, so now Ask To Turn and Offer to Turn is now unlocked. Servos can now be a Vampire from regular methods. Also more tunings have been overridden to allow some interactions to be hidden like Ask for Rite of Ascension for Spellcasters.

UPDATE 2: Fixed Instant Vampiric Transformation Spell Action Tuning - Forgot to change to the correct spell to unlock. Thanks Sages of Mastery Magic for repetitive teaching of the Vampiric Transformation Spell.

UPDATE 1: Added Missing Stringtables for other languages and Added new spell for Addon
