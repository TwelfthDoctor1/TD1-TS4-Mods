# No-Fade Columns in BuildBuy & Live Modes

#### Originally created by plasticbox, formerly maintained by coolspear1

As the original mod has not been updated since 2015 and is only for Base Game Columns only, I've decided to spend some time to rewrite and update this mod to work with the latest versions and add compatibly for Columns in Expansion Packs, Game Packs & Stuff packs.

The original mod only allows one variant of the Column to not fade, leaving the corner variants to still fade. I have rewritten and added the 8 other variants of each of the 12 Base Game Columns to no longer fade.
